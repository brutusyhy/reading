/*
The Union-Find problem deals with the representation of partitions over a base set.
We will identify the elements of the base set using the numbers 0, 1... 
and will represent partitions with a forest data structure where each element has a “parent” 
that is another element inside the same partition. Each set in such a partition is identified 
by a designated element called the root of the set. We want to perform two principal operations: 

A Find operation receives one element of the ground set and returns the root of the corresponding set. 
A Union operation receives two elements and merges the two sets to which these elements belong into one. 

Can you implement a forest data structure in an index table of base type size_t called parent?
Here, a value in the table SIZE_MAX would mean a position represents a root of one of the trees; 
another number represents position of the parent of the corresponding tree. 

One of the important features to start the implementation is an initialization function 
that makes parent the singleton partition: that is, the partition where each element is the 
root of its own private set.

With this index table, can you implement a Find function that, for a given index, finds the root of its tree? 
Can you implement a FindReplace function that changes all parent entries on a path to the root (including) 
to a specific value? 
Can you implement a FindCompress function that changes all parent entries to the root that has been found? 

Can you implement a Union function that, for two given elements, combines their trees into one? 
Use FindCompress for one side and FindReplace for the other.
